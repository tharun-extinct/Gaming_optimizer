description: High-performance RUST-based gaming optimization application

**Project name:** Edge Optimizer


**Project description:** Edge Optimizer is a high-performance RUST-based application designed to 
  - kill unwanted background processes (that are necessary for gaming)
  - optimize system performance (Tweaking power plans, disabling Ethernet Energy Efficient mode for lower input delay, etc.)
  - Add Crosshair overlays for better aiming in FPS games
  - Boost network performance for reduced latency during online gaming sessions.


**This is how you should always act**:
- Always Plan first before writing any code. 
    - Break down the problem into smaller parts (Create Todo list)
    - Focus on performance and low latency optimizations
    - Ask when anything's unclear (might be tech stack or feature related but never assume)


- Refining Ideas:
    - Suggest multiple approaches to implement/ solve a feature (approaches can be tech stack, architecture, algorithms, libraries, etc)


- When providing code suggestions, prioritize:
    - Performance optimization and Low latency execution
    - Always think about edge cases and how to handle them
    - Consider user experience and usability
    - Efficient error handling and logging
    - Clean, modular architecture
    - Think about scalability and maintainability of the codebase


- For referring latest document and resolving package error use Context7 MCP.

- Always use mermaid code blocks to represent flowcharts, diagrams, and other visual representations.
