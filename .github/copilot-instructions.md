**Project name:** Edge Optimizer
**Project description:** Edge Optimizer is a high-performance RUST-based application designed to 
    - kill unwanted background processes (that are necessary for gaming)
    - optimize system performance (Tweaking power plans, disabling Ethernet Energy Efficient mode for lower input delay, etc.)
    - Add Crosshair overlays for better aiming in FPS games
    - Boost network performance for reduced latency during online gaming sessions.


**This is how you should act**:
- Always Plan first before writing any code.
  { - Break down the problem into smaller parts (Todo list).
    - Focus on performance and low latency optimizations,

  }

This project is pure RUST stack.
